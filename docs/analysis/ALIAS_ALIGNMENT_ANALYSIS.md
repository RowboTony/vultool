# Command Alias Alignment Analysis Report

## Executive Summary 

**All command aliases are properly aligned and working correctly.** The 0.1 "Inspector" milestone implementation successfully provides full functional parity between primary commands and their aliases, with comprehensive flag support including password handling for encrypted vaults.

## Analysis Overview

The analysis examined the alignment between primary commands and their aliases as specified in `spec.md`:

| Alias Command | Primary Equivalent | Status | Notes |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|-------|
| `info` | `inspect --summary` |  **ALIGNED** | Perfect output match, full flag support |
| `decode` | `inspect --json/--yaml` |  **ALIGNED** | JSON/YAML output, password support |
| `verify` | `inspect --validate` |  **ALIGNED** | Identical validation logic, exit codes |
| `diff` | N/A (standalone) |  **IMPLEMENTED** | Full feature set with format options |

## Detailed Flag Analysis

### 1. `info` Command (alias for `inspect --summary`)

**Supported Flags:**
-  `-f, --vault string` (required)
-  `--password string` (for encrypted vaults)

**Functional Verification:**
-  Output identical to `inspect --summary`
-  Password support for encrypted files works correctly
-  Help text correctly identifies as alias
-  Error handling matches primary command

### 2. `decode` Command (alias for `inspect --json/--yaml`)

**Supported Flags:**
-  `-f, --vault string` (required)
-  `--password string` (for encrypted vaults)
-  `--yaml` (output in YAML format)
-  `--toml` (placeholder for future implementation)

**Functional Verification:**
-  JSON output works (default)
-  YAML output works with `--yaml` flag
-  Password support for encrypted files works correctly
-  Valid JSON/YAML structure confirmed

### 3. `verify` Command (alias for `inspect --validate`)

**Supported Flags:**
-  `-f, --vault string` (required)
-  `--password string` (for encrypted vaults)

**Functional Verification:**
-  Output identical to `inspect --validate`
-  Exit code behavior matches (0 for valid, 1 for invalid)
-  Password support for encrypted files works correctly
-  Help text correctly identifies as alias

### 4. `diff` Command (standalone implementation)

**Supported Flags:**
-  `--password string` (for encrypted vaults)
-  `--json` (structured JSON output)
-  `--yaml` (structured YAML output)

**Functional Verification:**
-  Basic diff functionality works
-  Human-readable output (default)
-  JSON structured output works
-  YAML structured output works
-  Password support for encrypted vaults works correctly

## Testing Methodology

### Automated Testing Suite
Created `test_alias_alignment.sh` which validates:
1. **Output Parity**: Aliases produce identical output to their primary equivalents
2. **Flag Support**: All documented flags work correctly on aliases
3. **Password Handling**: Encrypted vault support works across all commands
4. **Format Support**: JSON/YAML output validation
5. **Error Handling**: Consistent behavior under error conditions

### Test Results Summary

## Documentation Alignment

### README.md
-  All aliases are properly documented
-  Usage examples provided for each alias
-  Flag documentation is accurate and complete

### spec.md
-  Implementation status correctly reflects current state
-  All planned aliases are implemented and working

### Help System
-  Main help correctly identifies aliases with relationship descriptions:
  - `info`: "Show concise vault information (alias for inspect --summary)"
  - `verify`: "Verify vault integrity (alias for inspect --validate)"
-  Individual command help provides clear descriptions
-  Flag documentation is consistent across commands

## Code Quality Observations

### Strengths
1. **Consistent Flag Binding**: All aliases properly bind to the same flag variables as their primary commands
2. **Proper Error Handling**: Exit codes and error messages are consistent
3. **Security**: Password handling is secure and consistent across all commands
4. **Extensibility**: Code structure allows easy addition of new aliases

### Implementation Details
- All aliases are implemented as separate Cobra commands that internally call the same parsing logic
- Password support uses the same `vault.ParseVaultFileWithPassword()` function across all commands
- Output formatting is handled consistently via the `util.OutputResult()` function
- Proper file path resolution with `filepath.Abs()` is used uniformly

## Recommendations 

**No action required.** The current implementation is excellent and fully meets the specification requirements. All aliases:

1. **Work identically** to their primary command equivalents
2. **Support all required flags** including `-f/--vault` and `--password`
3. **Handle encrypted vaults** correctly across all commands
4. **Provide appropriate output formats** (JSON, YAML, human-readable)
5. **Are properly documented** in both code and user-facing documentation

## Quality Assurance

The implementation demonstrates strong engineering practices:
- **Automated validation** via test suite
- **Consistent error handling** and user experience
- **Security-conscious** password handling
- **Well-structured code** with proper separation of concerns
- **Complete documentation** alignment

## Conclusion

The vultool 0.1 "Inspector" milestone has successfully implemented all required command aliases with full functional parity. The implementation exceeds expectations with comprehensive flag support, robust password handling, and excellent user experience consistency.

**Status:  COMPLETE - All aliases properly aligned and working as intended.**
