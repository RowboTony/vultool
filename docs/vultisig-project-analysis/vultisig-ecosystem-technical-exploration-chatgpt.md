# Vultisig Ecosystem — Technical Exploration and Repository Survey

## 1 Introduction

Vultisig is an open‑source multi‑chain crypto wallet designed to remove the single point of failure of seed phrases.  Instead of storing a private key on one device, Vultisig splits the private key into multiple *shares* and signs transactions using a **threshold signature scheme (TSS)**.  The system uses multi‑party computation (MPC) to ensure that no single device ever has enough information to reconstruct the private key, yet collectively the devices can produce a valid ECDSA or EdDSA signature that looks like a normal single‑key signature to blockchains[docs.vultisig.com](https://docs.vultisig.com/threshold-signature-scheme/threshold-signature-schemes-used-by-vultisig#:~:text=Why Vultisig Upgraded to DKLS23).  This combination of seedless wallets, multi‑chain support and MPC based signatures is Vultisig’s key value proposition.

### 1.1 Threshold signature schemes (GG20 and DKLS23)

- **Legacy GG20** – Older Vultisig vaults were built using the GG20 threshold ECDSA protocol.  GG20 builds upon the Paillier homomorphic encryption used in the GG18/GG19 protocols and uses zero‑knowledge proofs to ensure parties behave correctly[docs.vultisig.com](https://docs.vultisig.com/threshold-signature-scheme/threshold-signature-schemes-used-by-vultisig/how-it-works#:~:text=In 2018%2C the ,party caused a protocol failure).  GG20 requires six communication rounds for signing and suffers from latency on mobile networks.
- **DKLS23** – In early 2025 Vultisig upgraded to DKLS23, a modern threshold ECDSA protocol developed by Silence Laboratories.  DKLS23 reduces signing rounds from six to three by replacing expensive Paillier operations with correlation‑robust oblivious transfer.  The scheme provides better reliability, lower battery consumption and works inside WebAssembly[docs.vultisig.com](https://docs.vultisig.com/threshold-signature-scheme/threshold-signature-schemes-used-by-vultisig/how-dkls23-works#:~:text=Evolution and Innovation).  A table on the official documentation compares the protocols; DKLS23 cuts signing latency (1.5 s vs ~5 s on iOS) and reduces network round‑trips[docs.vultisig.com](https://docs.vultisig.com/threshold-signature-scheme/threshold-signature-schemes-used-by-vultisig#:~:text=Comparing the Protocols).

Vultisig still supports GG20 vaults and provides a migration tool to convert them to DKLS23 via the VultiServer API[raw.githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vultisig/vultiserver/main/README.md#:~:text=if server return http status,means the code is invalid).

### 1.2 Vault types and signing flows

Vultisig uses **vaults** containing threshold key shares stored in `.vult` files.  Common configurations include:

- **Fast vaults (2‑of‑2)** – one share resides on the user device and the second share is stored on **Vultiserver** (also called VultiServer or Vultisigner).  This configuration lets a single device initiate and sign transactions instantly because the server is always online.  The server encrypts its share and emails a backup `.vult` file to the user during key generation[docs.vultisig.com](https://docs.vultisig.com/vultisig-infrastructure/what-is-vultisigner/how-does-vultisigner-work#:~:text=2).
- **Secure vaults (2‑of‑3 or higher)** – multiple user devices participate without relying on Vultiserver.  The initiating device creates a key‑generation session (via a local relay or Vultisig relay server), displays a QR code and waits for other devices to join.  Once the required devices join, the vault shares are created and each device stores its `.vult` file.  Signing a transaction involves scanning a QR code or pairing via the relay and executing a threshold signing ceremony[docs.vultisig.com](https://docs.vultisig.com/vultisig-vault-user-actions/signing-a-transaction/how-keysigning-works#:~:text=A device initiates a cryptographic,devices to join the session).
- **Swap functionality** – Vultisig integrates third‑party protocols like THORChain and Li.Fi to perform cross‑chain swaps.  Swaps are just special transaction types; they require a normal threshold signing ceremony.

The following diagram summarises the data flow during signing.  For fast vaults the VultiServer acts as one of the signing parties; for secure vaults the server is not used.



### 1.3 Roles of the relay and server

- **Vultisig Relay** – a lightweight service that relays TSS messages between devices.  Mobile devices cannot accept inbound connections, so the relay stores and forwards messages.  The `tss-director` repository states that a relay service is needed because mobile phones cannot accept inbound connections and thus cannot directly communicate with each other[raw.githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vultisig/tss-director/main/README.md#:~:text=TSS usually have multiple parties%2C,facilitate the communication %2C and).  The relay is used during both key generation and signing for multi‑device vaults.  A local network relay is also used for offline signing.
- **VultiServer (Vultisigner)** – a Go‑based TSS server used for fast vaults and for any client that cannot run the threshold library locally.  The VultiServer provides HTTP API endpoints for key generation (`/vault/create`), signing (`/vault/sign`), reshare, migration (GG20 → DKLS23) and other administrative operations[raw.githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vultisig/vultiserver/main/README.md#:~:text=Vultisigner %2F VultiServer consists of,perform the actual TSS operations).  It launches a TSS worker to perform cryptographic operations and sends the signed transaction back to the client.

### 1.4 Cross‑platform architecture

Vultisig targets iOS, Android, desktop (Windows/Linux) and a web extension.  To avoid re‑implementing cryptography in every language the team uses multiple layers (see diagram below):



1. **Cryptographic libraries** – Vultisig does not implement threshold cryptography from scratch.  It builds on existing libraries such as:
   - [`multi-party-sig`](https://github.com/vultisig/multi-party-sig), [`IBM‑TSS`](https://github.com/vultisig/IBM-TSS) and [`cait-sith`](https://github.com/vultisig/cait-sith) which provide ECDSA/Schnorr threshold signing protocols and network abstractions.
   - Silence Laboratories’ [`silent-shard-dkls23-ll`](https://github.com/vultisig/silent-shard-dkls23-ll) and [`multi-party-schnorr`](https://github.com/vultisig/multi-party-schnorr) for DKLS23 and FROST/Schnorr protocols.  These libraries expose Rust crates and WASM bindings for DKLS23.
2. **Cross‑platform wallet library** – Vultisig uses **Trust Wallet Core** (C++) to derive public/private keys and sign simple transactions for 130+ blockchains[raw.githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vultisig/wallet-core/master/README.md#:~:text=Trust Wallet Core is an,Kotlin) for Android).  Wallet Core is packaged as Swift/C++/Kotlin bindings and used by the Vultisig mobile apps.
3. **TSS binding layer** – the `mobile‑tss‑lib` repository (Go) wraps threshold protocols and provides a simple `ServiceImpl` interface.  It is compiled to iOS and Android libraries using `gomobile bind` (Go → Objective‑C/Swift or Java) and to WebAssembly for the browser extension.  The `dkls‑android` project builds `.aar` packages for DKLS and Schnorr to be consumed by the Android app[raw.githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vultisig/dkls-android/main/README.md#:~:text=This reporitory contains the source,build DKLS%2FSchnorr libraries for android).  There are also WASM bindings (`vultisig‑wasm`) for the browser extension.
4. **Relay & VultiServer** – the `vultisig‑relay` and `vultiserver` services route messages between parties and provide server‑side TSS for fast vaults.  The `tss‑director` is a minimal message‑forwarding service for mobile devices[raw.githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vultisig/tss-director/main/README.md#:~:text=TSS usually have multiple parties%2C,facilitate the communication %2C and).
5. **Client applications** – built on top of the above layers:
   - **iOS/macOS** – `vultisig‑ios` written in Swift uses `mobile‑tss‑lib` via gomobile‑generated `xcframework` and `Trust Wallet Core` via the Swift Package Manager.  It is considered the flagship app and receives new features first.
   - **Android** – `vultisig‑android` in Kotlin uses `WalletCore` and the `dkls‑android` bindings.  The README notes the need to configure GitHub tokens because WalletCore is hosted on GitHub[raw.githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vultisig/vultisig-android/main/README.md#:~:text=[![Android CI](https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvultisig%2Fvultisig,android app).
   - **Desktop (Windows/Linux)** – `vultisig‑windows` is a monorepo containing the desktop app (built with the Wails framework – Go backend with a React/TypeScript frontend) and the **VultiConnect** browser extension.  Code is organized in domain‑driven layers (`lib/`, `core/`, `clients/`) and uses `mobile‑tss‑lib` via CGO.  The extension acts as a safer version of MetaMask, bridging Vultisig vaults to dApps and only storing public information[raw.githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vultisig/vultisig-windows/main/README.md#:~:text=).
   - **Web app and extension** – `vultisig‑web` is a view‑only React app for the airdrop registry[raw.githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vultisig/vultisig-web/main/README.md#:~:text=The Vultisig Web App serves,information on Thorchain and MayaChain).  `vultisig‑windows/clients/extension` and `vulticonnect` implement the Chrome extension; the latter is being consolidated into the monorepo[raw.githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vultisig/vulticonnect/main/README.md#:~:text=We are moving VultiConnect repository,share some of the code).  They expose `window.vultisig` objects so dApps can call `ethereum.request`‑like methods[docs.vultisig.com](https://docs.vultisig.com/developer-docs/vultisig-extension-integration-guide#:~:text=Vultisig Extension is a Chrome,Vultisig Extension introduces).

This cross‑platform strategy allows re‑use of cryptographic code and ensures that the behaviour of TSS protocols is consistent across platforms.  However, maintaining four different front‑end code bases (iOS, Android, desktop, extension) can still lead to feature divergence.  In Section 4 we discuss potential improvements.

## 2 Repository survey

Vultisig maintains over 45 public repositories.  The following table summarises each repository’s primary purpose, grouped by category.  Repositories with no updates since 29 July 2024 would be placed in a “Suspected dormant” section; however, every repository in the list has been updated within one year, so none are currently classified as dormant.

## 3 Key observations and evaluation

1. **Modular architecture** – Vultisig’s architecture deliberately separates cryptography (third‑party libraries) from wallet logic and UI layers.  This modularity reduces security risk and allows the team to replace or upgrade TSS protocols (e.g., migrating from GG20 to DKLS23) without rewriting UI code.  However, it introduces complexity in the build process (Go, Rust, C++, Swift, Kotlin, TypeScript) and the need to maintain bridging code (`gomobile`, `wasm`).
2. **Cryptography stack** – The core cryptographic operations are not implemented by Vultisig; they rely heavily on external libraries such as `multi-party-sig`, `cait-sith`, `IBM-TSS` and Silence Labs’ DKLS23 implementation.  This provides strong security assurances (audited code) but requires careful integration and version management.
3. **Server dependence** – Fast vaults depend on the VultiServer.  Although this makes the user experience simple, it introduces a central point of failure.  The server’s API includes migration endpoints, reshare and resend features[raw.githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vultisig/vultiserver/main/README.md#:~:text=Vultisigner %2F VultiServer consists of,perform the actual TSS operations), which need to be secured; the code appears open source but should be audited.  The Verifier service and plugin marketplace further expand the server footprint and integrate policy checks.
4. **Cross‑platform UI** – The iOS app is considered the flagship and often receives features first; the Android and desktop clients lag behind.  The desktop client uses Wails, combining Go backend with a web front‑end; the extension shares some code.  This structure provides near‑native performance but requires knowledge of multiple languages.  Emerging technologies like Flutter (Dart) or React Native could potentially unify the UI layer while preserving native performance; however, cryptography integration and secure enclaves on mobile devices may still require platform‑specific code.
5. **Testing and CI/CD** – The repositories contain few unit tests.  The Android README describes manual port forwarding for emulator testing[raw.githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vultisig/vultisig-android/main/README.md#:~:text=).  There is no evidence of cross‑platform integration tests.  A CLI tool (`vultisig‑toolbox`) is planned but not yet implemented.  Building automated tests around the CLI could improve reliability and reduce manual QA.
6. **Documentation** – Vultisig’s GitBook (`docs` repo) provides a high‑level overview of vault types, threshold protocols and user actions[raw.githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vultisig/docs/main/README.md#:~:text=) but lacks detailed developer guides for many components.  The extension integration guide lists `window.vultisig.ethereum` etc. and emphasises compatibility[docs.vultisig.com](https://docs.vultisig.com/developer-docs/vultisig-extension-integration-guide#:~:text=Vultisig Extension is a Chrome,Vultisig Extension introduces), but there is little documentation for internal APIs.  Improving documentation and consolidating knowledge (currently in Discord) would help external contributors.

## 4 Recommendations for a cross‑platform CLI and future improvements

- **CLI foundation (vultisig‑toolbox/vultisig‑go)** – before writing a CLI, standardise the Go library that wraps TSS and wallet operations.  The `mobile‑tss‑lib` already exposes a `ServiceImpl` interface for keygen and sign; a Go wrapper with CLI commands (`vault create`, `vault sign`, `vault migrate`, `vault decode`) could call this interface.  The CLI could then be compiled for Linux/macOS/Windows and used in CI tests.  This would also provide an SDK for other wallets to import `.vult` files.
- **Automated testing** – implement integration tests for each platform by scripting the CLI and comparing results across iOS/Android/desktop.  Use the CLI to simulate vault creation, reshare and signing; verify that `.vult` files can be restored on other devices and that signatures are valid on‑chain.  The tests should cover both GG20 and DKLS vaults.
- **Unify front‑end development** – evaluate cross‑platform UI frameworks.  Flutter may allow a single codebase for iOS and Android and can integrate with native libraries via FFI.  React Native could reuse TypeScript code from the desktop and extension.  Both options require bridging the cryptographic libraries and secure storage (Keychain/Android Keystore), so the savings may be moderate.
- **Document build & release pipeline** – create developer documentation describing how to build each platform (including environment setup, required tokens, `gomobile bind`, DKLS builds, Wails packaging, etc.), and automate release builds via GitHub Actions.  The existing `vultisig‑windows` README already outlines a domain‑driven structure[raw.githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vultisig/vultisig-windows/main/README.md#:~:text=); similar guidelines should be added for iOS and Android.
- **Audit server code** – ensure that VultiServer and Verifier follow best practices for key storage, password handling and rate‑limiting.  Because the server holds encrypted vault shares and can sign transactions, any breach could affect fast‑vault users.  Regular security reviews and penetration tests are recommended.

## 5 Conclusion

Vultisig is an ambitious project combining threshold cryptography, multi‑chain wallet infrastructure and a multi‑platform user experience.  Its open‑source repositories reveal a modular, well‑layered architecture in which cryptographic protocols and wallet logic are separated from UI code.  Upgrading from GG20 to DKLS23 has reduced signing latency and improved mobile reliability[docs.vultisig.com](https://docs.vultisig.com/threshold-signature-scheme/threshold-signature-schemes-used-by-vultisig#:~:text=Comparing the Protocols).  However, the ecosystem is complex, and consistent documentation, automated testing and unified development practices are needed to scale.  A CLI tool built on top of the existing Go libraries would provide a foundation for testing and serve as an SDK for third parties, bringing Vultisig closer to its goal of being the “definitive seedless wallet” for the AI agent era.
