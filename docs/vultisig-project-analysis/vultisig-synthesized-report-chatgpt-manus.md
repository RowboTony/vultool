# Vultisig Ecosystem — Technical Exploration and Repository Survey (Synthesized, July 2025)

## 1. Introduction

Vultisig is an open-source, MPC-based, seedless crypto wallet with advanced TSS, targeting both retail users and security-conscious teams.  
This report merges a full repo audit (with up-to-date “suspected dormant” sections), a technical deep dive, architecture insights, and recommendations—combining Manus’s structured narrative with an explicit GitHub repo survey and diagrams.

### SUSPECTED DORMANT REPOSITORIES

None are truly dormant as of July 2025. Every repo in the Vultisig org has been updated or at least touched in the last year. However, the following may be low-activity, internal-only, or historical research/experiments:

| Repo Name            | Purpose / Status                                                                        |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| tss-research         | Cryptography research/prototype. Little recent code, but touched for archival purposes. |
| tss-lib-upgrade      | Upgrade fork of TSS library. Mainly used for testing and evaluation.                   |
| vultiphone           | Web project for “Vultiphone”—likely just marketing or demo, not a maintained product.  |
| vultichain           | Placeholder for a future chain project—possibly inactive.                              |
| copytrading          | Repo is updated, but unclear if active development is happening; may be WIP or shelved.|
| Branding             | Logo/assets repo—static, but still serves a purpose.                                   |

## 3. Synthesized Technical/Architecture Analysis

### A. Core Concepts

- **Seedless design:** No single device ever holds the full private key. MPC/TSS means user’s vault is always split across devices and/or a trusted server.
- **.vult files:** Share files per device. These can be exported/imported, used for recovery, and are cross-device compatible (i.e., load iOS share on Mac, etc).
- **Vault modes:**  
    - **Fast Vaults:** 2-of-2, one share on device, one on Vultiserver (tradeoff: convenience vs. trust in server).
    - **Secure Vaults:** 2-of-3 or more, only on user devices (max security).
- **Swaps:**  
    - **ThorChain:** L1-native swaps (BTC, ETH, etc).
    - **Li.Fi:** DEX/bridge aggregator.

### B. Key Components

- **Mobile apps:** iOS (Swift) and Android (Kotlin/Java). Both use Go “mobile-tss-lib” for TSS keygen/signing. WalletCore for blockchain ops.
- **Desktop:** Wails (Go backend, TS/React UI). Go is used directly—no need for mobile bindings.
- **Web extension:** Vulticonnect (TypeScript). Seedless browser wallet. Exposes Vultisig to dApps.
- **Vultiserver:** Relays TSS messages, stores share for Fast Vaults. Written in Go.
- **Plugins/SDK:** For integrating Vultisig TSS in other wallets or 3rd-party tools.

### C. Development Workflow & Tech Stack

- **Go (Golang):** Universal core for TSS and most backend code.
- **Mobile TSS library:** `mobile-tss-lib` (Go) is shared among all clients.
- **Wails:** For desktop (Windows/Linux). Good Go-native choice.
- **Flutter (recommendation):** Could be used to unify iOS/Android into one codebase (Dart).
- **Web:** Vulticonnect and vultisig-web as separate projects.
- **Docs:** Improving, but needs more SDK and onboarding coverage.

### D. Security

- **Vultiserver:** Trust-minimized but not trustless. Compromise of server risks Fast Vaults (2-of-2).
- **All cryptography open-source:** Auditable by community.
- **.vult file handling:** Users need to protect their shares; security depends on device security.

### E. Recommendations (Merged from Both Reports)

- **Move to Flutter for mobile:** Unifies code, easier maintenance, leverages Go backend.
- **Keep Wails for desktop:** Great Go-centric workflow; could extend to macOS.
- **Formalize SDK, plugin, and onboarding docs:** To enable 3rd-party devs and wallet integrations.
- **Automate testing/monitoring:** Build vultisignal dashboard for real TSS/swap/regression tests.
- **Continue security audits:** Encourage external review, transparency.

         [Vultiserver (optional, Fast Vaults only)]
```

## 5. Key Differences and Gaps (My Commentary)

* **No “dead” code, but some research/playground repos:** All repos are “active,” but some (IBM-TSS, cait-sith, etc) are research forks or testbeds—important for credibility, but not user-facing.
* **Docs are weakest link:** You’ll onboard much slower than you should if you’re not a senior Go/mobile dev. This is a fixable issue, and Manus’s recommendations are spot-on.
* **Dev/test infra needs “grown-up” upgrade:** Vultisignal and more CI/CD would let them catch swap, TSS, and cross-chain breakage faster.
* **Open, auditable, modular:** Vultisig’s open repo culture and modular code (Go TSS, plugins, web SDKs) is more like a protocol project than a “wallet company.”
* **Clear, realistic path for 3rd-party integrations:** If plugin/SDK/docs are prioritized, Vultisig can become the “backend” for seedless security in other wallets.
* **Flutter is the most pragmatic step forward:** If Vultisig wants true mobile UX parity and easier feature rollouts, moving iOS/Android to Flutter is the way.
