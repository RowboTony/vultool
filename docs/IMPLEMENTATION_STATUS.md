## Known Issues and Limitations

### Fixed Issues
- ✅ Bitcoin Cash addresses now use proper CashAddr encoding (was hardcoded)
- ✅ SUI addresses now use proper Blake2b hashing (was hardcoded)
- ✅ Address derivation consistency between `list-addresses` and `list-paths`

### Current Limitations
- DKLS recovery is not implemented (GG20 only)
- No transaction signing capabilities yet
- No swap/DeFi integration
- Limited blockchain validation beyond address generation

## Version History

### v0.3.0 (Current)
- ✅ Fixed Bitcoin Cash CashAddr encoding using bchutil library
- ✅ Fixed SUI address derivation using Blake2b hashing
- ✅ Unified address derivation implementations
- ✅ Added comprehensive development principles documentation
- ✅ Enhanced error handling and validation

### v0.2.0
- ✅ Added GG20 recovery functionality
- ✅ Implemented address derivation for major chains
- ✅ Added JSON/YAML export capabilities

### v0.1.0
- ✅ Basic .vult file parsing
- ✅ Vault information extraction
- ✅ CLI framework and commands

## Development Principles Compliance

This project now follows strict anti-placeholder principles:

- ❌ **No silent stubs**: All unimplemented features return explicit errors
- ✅ **Fail fast**: Missing functionality fails immediately with clear messages
- ✅ **Clear status**: This document tracks implementation status transparently
- ✅ **Progressive implementation**: Features are built incrementally with validation

## Future Roadmap

### Short Term (Next Release)
- [ ] DKLS recovery implementation
- [ ] Enhanced error messages and validation
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] Additional test coverage

### Medium Term
- [ ] Transaction signing capabilities
- [ ] Vault creation functionality
- [ ] Enhanced security auditing
- [ ] Plugin architecture for new chains

### Long Term
- [ ] Swap/DeFi integration
- [ ] GUI interface
- [ ] Advanced key management
- [ ] Multi-vault operations
